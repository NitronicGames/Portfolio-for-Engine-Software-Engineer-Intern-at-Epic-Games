# Hi, I’m Ethan Weatherly!

I’m a student game developer learning Unreal Engine 5. Most of my work so far has been in Blueprints, but I’m teaching myself C++ and want to move more into programming and technical design.  

I’ve made and released games on Itch.io, worked on jam projects, and I’m currently building a larger project called **Doomed Destiny**. I enjoy designing systems, building levels from sketches to whiteboxes, and figuring out how gameplay fits together. I also love learning new things, improving upon myself, and hearing feedback from people so that I can get closer to my goals!

## Projects

### Doomed Destiny *(in progress)*
Unreal Engine 5 | Systems + Level Design  

- Started with flowcharts and a brainstorming document.
- Created a game design document and pitch deck to refine the concept.  
- Built a whiteboxed map from my 2D sketches.
- Placed in key assets and blokced out main areas for flow testing.
- Continuing to polish while also learning how to extend systems with C++.

### Game Jams
- **Lost Relic Jam (Group)** – prototyped mechanics under a short deadline with freinds.  
- **Trust No One Jam (Group)** – focused on level flow and small systems while networking with people.

## Docs and Planning
I plan projects before building to help manage my ideas and keep the final product close to the original vision. 
Here are some of the docs for *Doomed Destiny*:

## Learning
Right now I’m focused on getting better at Unreal C++:  
- Following tutorials and rebuilding Blueprint features in code.  
- I will be logging my progress in a small repo: [Blueprint-to-C++ Learning](your-link).

## Goal
I want to work as or work my way up to become a **Technical Designer, System Designer, or a Game Programmer**.  
I enjoy building systems that support gameplay and learning how engine tools work under the hood.
