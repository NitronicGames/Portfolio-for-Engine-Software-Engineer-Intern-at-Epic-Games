# 👋 Hi, I’m [Your Name]  
**Aspiring Engine Programmer | Technical Designer | Systems Thinker**  

I’m a student game developer specializing in **Unreal Engine 5**, with a strong foundation in **Blueprints** and a growing focus on **C++ programming** and **engine-side development**.  

I’ve published games, shipped prototypes, and designed system documentation—from **GDDs and Vision Docs** to full whitebox levels. My goal is to build scalable, efficient systems and evolve into a **Game Programmer or Technical Designer** within AAA studios.
