# Hi, I’m [Your Name]

I’m a student game developer learning Unreal Engine 5. Most of my work so far has been in Blueprints, but I’m teaching myself C++ and want to move more into programming and technical design.  

I’ve made and released games on Itch.io, worked on jam projects, and I’m currently building a larger project called **Doomed Destiny**. I enjoy designing systems, building levels from sketches to whiteboxes, and figuring out how gameplay fits together. I also love learning new things, improving upon myself, and hearing feedback from people so that I can get closer to my goals!

## Projects

### Doomed Destiny *(in progress)*
Unreal Engine 5 | Systems + Level Design  

- Started with flowcharts and a game design document to map out ideas.  
- Built whitebox levels from 2D sketches.  
- Added enemy AI, player abilities, and wave spawner systems in Blueprints.  
- Currently learning how to rebuild these systems in C++.

## Learning
Right now I’m focused on getting better at Unreal C++:  
- Following tutorials and rebuilding Blueprint features in code.  
- Logging progress in a small repo: [Blueprint-to-C++ Learning](your-link).

## Goal
I want to work as a **Game Programmer, Technical Designer, or System Designer**.  
I enjoy building systems that support gameplay and learning how engine tools work under the hood.
